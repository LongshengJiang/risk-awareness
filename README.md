# risk-awareness
This repository provide the simulation code and the raw data for the risk-aware decision-making in human-robot collaborative search application.

- The raw data recorded for the paper is contained in `data\`
- The simulation programs are also provided. `multi-visit-strategy` and `single-visit-strategy` are two variants of the same program. 
  - `multi-visit-strategy` means a robot can revisit and redetect a domain cell until its confidence about the detection passes a threshold.
  - `single-visit-strategy` means a robot can visit and detect a domain cell only once. 
  - Please go down the directory to see more detailed explanation.
